			<h2>Danielle (Duck) Martinez</h2><br>

			<p3>Hello my name is Danielle, but you can call me Duck, a nickname I aquired at a very young age from my twin sister who could not say Danielle because it is obviously a very difficult name for a 6 year old and instead called me "Daki" and from that Duck was born. I am a graphic designer from El Paso, Texas, U.S.A. My love for expressing myself through art began at a young age when I got interested in reading, mostly fantasy. I became addicted to books, and the way authors could create their own worlds so descriptively blew my mind. I collected my favorite titles and began to (for lack of a better word) “judge” their covers. I loved how an artist could condense a vast and imaginative world into a single image. I would sit and look at the covers and find new details that referenced certain events in the book like it was my new favorite game. After graduating high school, I figured out that graphic design was something I could go to school for and I knew I wanted to pursue it. I wanted to be the artist behind my favorite game and maybe some new book lover could feel exactly how I felt seeing my work on a book they adored.
	When I am not doing art, I am going to my book club meetings or hanging out with my twin sister who could not be more of my opposite.
